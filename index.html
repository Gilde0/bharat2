    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <section id="guide-section">
    <h2>Bharatclub Playing & Earning Guide</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Guide 1: How to play Wingo Responsibly</h3>
      <p>
        If you're interested in playing Wingo, we recommend starting by focusing on betting Big or Small rather than choosing colors or numbers. Why? Because the odds of these bets are generally more predictable, offering a balanced approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it might seem like a 50/50 chance, there are other factors at play, such as patterns and trends that experienced players observe. These insights can sometimes guide your decisions, but remember, they are not foolproof strategies. There’s always an element of uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s important to understand that no prediction is ever a guarantee. This is a game that involves some level of luck, so make sure to approach it with a level head. Always use logic and play within your means. Betting on a single outcome repeatedly, like betting on Violet several times in a row, could lead to unexpected losses — and we want to help you avoid that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, always manage your budget and remember that gambling should be a form of entertainment, not a way to make money. If you ever feel the game is no longer fun or you’re losing more than you can afford, take a break and review your approach.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Guide 2: How to earn money with Wingo</h3>
      <p>
        You may have heard of the "double your bet after a loss" strategy. It sounds logical, right? The idea is to recover your losses, but in Wingo, this method can be risky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why? Because while you may win a round, your payout won't be double your bet due to the platform's small fee deductions. So, if you keep doubling your bet, there's a chance you could end up losing more than you gain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, consider a more thoughtful approach: instead of doubling your bet, try increasing it moderately, for example, to 3x after a loss. However, it’s crucial to do this strategically. Observe the results and trends — for instance, if “Small” results appear multiple times, you might decide to switch your bet to “Big.” But, remember, patterns can change, and sometimes the results are unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're ever unsure, there are experienced players who analyze game trends and share their insights. While some advice may be valuable, always make your own decisions and trust your judgment. Gambling should be fun and mindful, not about chasing losses.
      </p>
      <p>
        And while a lucky coin might bring some fun to your game, remember to stay in control and play responsibly. 🎲
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
     <h3>Guide 3: How to Earn Money Without Playing</h3>
    <p>
      Don’t want to play? No problem. BharatClub offers a referral program where you can earn by inviting others to join the platform. You can earn rewards for each new user who registers through your unique invitation code.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, simply go to the <strong>Promotion</strong> tab in the app. There, you will find your personalized <strong>invitation code</strong>, <strong>QR code</strong>, and a <strong>direct link</strong> to share. Share these with friends, family, or anyone who might be interested in joining.
    </p>
    <p>
      When new users sign up and engage with the platform, you earn <strong>bonuses and commissions</strong>. It’s straightforward, but there’s an important detail: the referred users must be <strong>verified, active players</strong>. This helps ensure a positive, legitimate community.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about the referral process or commission structure, feel free to check out the FAQ. If you need further clarification, you can always contact support or join the relevant channel for more information.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Guide 4: Become a Platform Partner and Earn Rewards!</h3>
      <p>
        Join our team as a trusted partner and enjoy daily earnings, bonuses, and marketing support — all for helping us grow a genuine community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your job? Simple: promote the platform. You can use YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, Google Ads, Meta Ads, carrier pigeons — whatever works. Just bring in active users who actually play.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait! Don’t even think about fake accounts. We’re looking for quality, not quantity. Members must be <strong>verified and active</strong>. The better your performance, the better your rewards — and this is all tracked on a <strong>daily basis</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re skilled with social media, passionate about gaming, or looking for a flexible way to earn online, this opportunity is for you.
